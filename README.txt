This project is a report that takes in a csv file of the most popular names for boys from 1974 to 2020 and creates a neat table listing the popular names. The input for the report is a csv file called "babaynames.csv" that contains all the data. The report was generated by creating an AWK script that takes in the data from the csv file. This was all done using the Ubuntu terminal in windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

This project repository contains the Makefile as well as the csv file that is the input for the AWK script, it also contain a AWK script file.
